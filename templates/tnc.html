It's not alright to post rough or violent substance that is essentially proposed to be shocking,
exciting, or unwarranted. If posting such a substance, it would be ideal if you be careful to

not to urge others to submit explicit demonstrations of violence.
<br><br><h3 align="start">Harassment and cyberbullying</h3>
It's not alright to post damaging recordings and remarks. If provocation goes too far into a
malevolent assault it very well may be accounted for and might be expelled. In different

<br><br>
<h3 align="start">Copyright</h3>
In many countries, when a person creates an original piece of work that is fixed in a physical medium, they automatically own the copyright to the work. As the copyright owner, they have the exclusive right to use the work. Most of the time, only the copyright owner can say whether someone else has permission to use the work.
<br><br>
<h3 align="start">Work subjected to copyright are :</h3>
Audiovisual works, such as TV shows, movies and online videos
Sound recordings and musical compositions
Written works, such as lectures, articles, books and musical compositions
Visual works, such as paintings, posters and advertisements
Video games and computer software
Dramatic works, such as plays and musicals
Ideas, facts and processes are not subject to copyright. According to copyright law, in order to be eligible for copyright protection, a work must be creative and it must be fixed in a tangible medium. Names and titles are not, by themselves, subject to copyright.
<br><br>
<h3 align="start">Can THEATRON determine copyright ownership?</h3>
No. Theatron isn't able to mediate rights ownership disputes. When we receive a complete and valid takedown notice, we remove the content as the law requires. When we receive a valid counter-notification, we forward it to the person who requested the removal. After this, it's up to the parties involved to resolve the issue in court.
<br><br>
<h3 align="start">Is copyright the same as a trademark?</h3>
Copyright is just one form of intellectual property. It's not the same as a trademark, which protects brand names, mottos, logos and other source identifiers from being used by others for certain purposes. It is also different from patent law, which protects inventions.
<br><br>
<h3 align="start">What is the difference between copyright and privacy?</h3>
Just because you appear in a video, image or audio recording does not mean that you own the copyright to it. For example, if your friend filmed a conversation between the two of you, she would own the copyright to that video recording. The words that the two of you are speaking are not subject to copyright separately from the video itself unless they were fixed in advance.
If your friend, or someone else, has uploaded a video, image or recording of you without your permission and you feel that it violates your privacy or safety, you may wish to report to us on theatronsquare@theatron.in
